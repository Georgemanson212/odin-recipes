        <ul>
            <li>recipe pastry for a 9-inch pie crust</li>
            <li>pounds heirloom tomatoes</li>
            <li>pound Roma tomatoes</li>
            <li>cup diced raw bacon</li>
            <li>cup sliced leek</li>
            <li>cups grated white Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>cup grated Fontina cheese</li>
            <li>cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>cup fresh basil, torn into small pieces</li>
            <li>egg</li>
            <li>tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>inch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Chill pie dough for about 1 hour</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place a baking sheet on the lower oven rack</li>
            <li>Slice heirloom tomatoes into 1/2-inch rounds. Remove seeds with your fingers. Place 6 slices on paper towels or a clean cloth and cover with more paper towels or another clean cloth. Arrange the remaining slices on a wire rack. Cut Roma tomatoes into 1/2-inch slices, remove seeds, and arrange them on the rack as well</li>
            <li>Carefully remove the foil and the weights. Cover the edges of the crust with foil to prevent them from burning. Poke the bottom of the pie crust with a fork to keep it from puffing up. Return the pie crust to the bottom rack and bake until the bottom starts to color, about 8 more minutes</li>
            <li>Remove pie crust and allow to cool. Continue baking the tomatoes until they are wilted, about 40 minutes total. Remove and allow to cool. Keep the oven on</li>
            <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until some of the fat has rendered, about 5 minutes. Add sliced leek. Cook until bacon is crisp and the leeks have softened and browned, about 5 more minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels and allow to cool</li>
            <li>Place bacon-leek mixture, Cheddar, Fontina, mayonnaise, basil, egg, and mustard in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Mix to combine</li>
            <li>Spread 1/3 mixture on the bottom of the pie crust. Arrange 1/2 of the roasted tomatoes on top, overlapping heirlooms with Roma tomatoes. Spread another 1/3 of the mixture over the tomatoes and arrange the remaining roasted tomatoes on top. Add the last 1/3 of the mixture and gently press the fresh tomato slices on top in a decorative pattern. Arrange foil around the edges of the pie crust to protect them from burning, taking care that the foil doesn't touch the tomatoes</li>
            <li>Bake until browned and bubbly on top, about 40 minutes. Cool completely before serving</li>
        </ol>
